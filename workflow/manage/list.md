# List workflows

To list all workflows deployed on the Network, run the command:

```bash
mesg-cli workflow list
```

This command will return all deployed workflows with basic information. To have more details, see the [detail command](/./workflow/manage/detail.md).

Optionally, you can filter the workflows deployed by a specific user:

```bash
mesg-cli workflow list --account ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```
