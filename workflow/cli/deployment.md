# Deployment

When you created your [workflow file](./file.md), [validate](./validation.md) it and [test](./testing.md) it you are ready to deploy it.

Each deployment will cost you a small amount of {{ book.token }} be aware that this amount is not refundable so please make sure to test your workflow correctly.

You can deploy your workflow using the command

```bash
mesg-cli workflow deploy worfklow.yml
```

If your workflow is valid it will be deployed through the {{ book.network }} and will be ready to be executed

Congratulation you have deploy your first MESG workflow that connect technologies through the {{ book.network }}.
