# What is a workflow ?

A workflow is the link between an event on one service to a command on another service.

Workflows will let you connect anything from any technology to anything else you want.

## When should I use workflows?

If you want to connect different services together, even those coming from different technologies, but you have no skills in knowing to connect with those technologies. Or, if you are a company or developer that wants to connect different services but don't want to lose a lot of time learning all those technologies and how to interact with them so that you can just focus on your most important work.

Also if you are worried about data centralization and single points of failure, workflows are great because it runs in a secure decentralized architecture.

You can find a list of potential use cases [here](use-cases.md)

## Steps in a workflow

There are 4 different steps in a workflow. 2 required and 2 optionals.
