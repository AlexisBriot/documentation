# Create Your Application

Applications can be built on MESG by attaching an event on one service to a command on another service. These can be configured in any order, and can create chain reactions. Infinite services can be combined from any technology, and connected together using Core.

## When should I create an Application?

In Q3 2018 once the Network is deployed, users can combine connections that other developers created to build a new solution.   
  
This will be especially useful for those who do not have the skills to connect technologies to your application. Or, if you are a company or developer that wants to connect different services but don't want to take a lot of time to learn all of those technologies. Allowing users to just focus on creation.

Also if data centralization and single points of failure are a concern, applications built using the MESG Infrastructure provide a solution because it runs in a secure decentralized architecture.

You can find a list of potential use cases [here](use-cases.md)

## Steps in an Application

There are 4 different steps to a basic application. 2 required and 2 optional.

1. [Source](source.md): The event that triggers the workflow. 
2. [Task](task.md): The task to trigger
