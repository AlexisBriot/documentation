# Application

Applications can be built on MESG by attaching an event on one service to a command on another service. These can be configured in any order, and can create chain reactions. As many services as you would like can be combined, from any technology, and are connected together using MESG Core.

## When should I create an Application?

Create an application if you want to connect different services together, even those coming from different technologies, but don't have the skills to connect those technologies. Or, if you are a company or developer that wants to connect different services but don't want to lose a lot of time learning all those technologies, and how to interact with them so that you can just focus on your most important work.

Also if you are concerned about data centralization and single points of failure, applications built using the MESG Infrastructure are great because it runs in a secure decentralized architecture.

You can find a list of potential use cases [here](use-cases.md)

## Steps in an Application

There are 4 different steps to a basic application. 2 required and 2 optional.

1. [Source](): The event that triggers the workflow. 
2. [Task](task.md): The task to trigger
