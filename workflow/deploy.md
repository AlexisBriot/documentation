# Deploy

When you have finish to create your [workflow file](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/workflow/file.md), [validate it](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/workflow/validation.md) and [test it](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/workflow/testing.md), you are ready to deploy it.

Each deployment will cost you a small amount of token. Be aware that this amount is **not refundable** so please make sure to test your workflow correctly.

You can deploy your workflow using the command:

```bash
mesg-cli workflow deploy ./PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_FILE
```

If your workflow is valid, it will be deployed through the Network and will be ready to be executed.

Congratulation! You have deployed your first MESG workflow that connect technologies through the Network.
