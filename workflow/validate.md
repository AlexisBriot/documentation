# Validate

Before each deployment, your file will be verified by the Application, but you can check if your file is well-formatted and valid at any time using the following command :

```bash
mesg-cli workflow validate ./PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_FILE
```

This command will validate your file and let you know if there are any errors. All validations can be found in the [file](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/workflow/file.md) section, or in the [JSON schema](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/workflow/%7B%7B%20book.endpoints.validationSchema%20%7D%7D).
