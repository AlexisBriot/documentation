# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Work in progress

MESG is an open-source decentralized architecture which makes all technologies, on or off the blockchain interoperable. It’s a building platform for developers.

Instead of making individual connections to each technology you want to use, you can now make a single connection to [Core](start-here/core.md), which will manage the connections to all other technologies. It manages the receiving and deployment of information and tasks, which means that maintaining apps is a breeze.  

This technology-agnostic hub allows all technologies to play nicely together, ushering in a new era of productivity and possibilities.

**Arriving Q3 2018:**

Once a connection from a technology to Core is made, it can be shared for free or sold in a Marketplace, allowing developers to generate income each time their connection is used.

Take the best of what has already been created to build your custom solution. Our building platform allows you to connect technologies without needing to know the languages of the technologies you're using.

Get involved by writing code or creating viable products, all while benefiting from an incentive system designed to reward building.

We’re excited to see what you come up with.
