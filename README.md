# Introduction


MESG is an infrastructure that allows you to create workflows in order to automatize anything you want.

Every time an event occurs on one technology, you can attach it to a list of tasks to execute based on that event. This lets you connect any type of service, from a simple mail provider, to the most complex blockchain technology, or even the entire IoT \(Internet of Things\) simply by defining which event connects to which task.

The goal of MESG is to help build applications that are not restricted by the complexity of the technologies you want to connect to. 

MESG also provides a shared tool library that you can use to create different workflows, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you create something new. 

If you are a developer and want to create complex workflows you should check out the , otherwise you can create a workflow anytime using the .

## A decentralized infrastructure

MESG is a decentralized infrastructure based on Blockchain technology, so your application is secure and is not controlled by anyone else than you \(and the people you want to give access to\). This also means that the infrastructure relies heavily on **YOU.**

The MESG infrastructure will be running on every single user, and the more users participating in the network, the more secure workflows will be, so we highly encourage you to run the application and start some services.
