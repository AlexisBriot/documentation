# Introduction

**The MESG Network is a technology-agnostic infrastructure for decentralized app development. It’s for connecting technologies and bringing innovations together.  
  
**MESG’s existing connections to various technologies allow you to quickly connect services to an application, or design a series of tasks that will execute automatically.  
  
It provides infinite possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs to create, share or combine existing services to build new and better solutions.

All on and off-chain technologies can be connected to MESG, and connections can be shared on MESG Network either freely or at a marketplace where you can put your applications up for sale.  
  
Apps are no longer constrained by the complexities of the technologies they rely on. Connecting to complex technologies easily can be added, changed or updated.

The days of manually connecting hundreds of services to achieve one workflow are over.

Build with efficiency and ease. 2 of our favorite words.

MESG makes it possible for the entire internet to be a transparent, open-source, cheap, efficient, and decentralized place. 

All technologies working together accelerates efficiencies and the discoveries of new solutions.
