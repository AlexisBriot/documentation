# Introduction

**The MESG Network is a technology-agnostic infrastructure for decentralized app development. It’s for connecting technologies and bringing innovations together.  
  
**MESG’s existing connections to various technologies allow you to quickly connect services to an application, or design a series of tasks that will execute automatically.  
  
It provides infinite possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs to create, share or combine existing services to build new and better solutions.

Every time an event occurs on one technology, you can attach it to a list of tasks to execute based on that event. This lets you connect any type of service, from a simple mail provider, to the most complex blockchain technology, or even the entire IoT \(Internet of Things\).

The goal of MESG is to help build applications that are not restricted by the complexity of the technologies you want to connect to.

MESG also provides a shared tool library that you can use to create different workflows, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you create something new.

## A decentralized infrastructure

MESG is a decentralized infrastructure that utilizes blockchain technology, so your application is secure and is not controlled by anyone else than you \(and the people you want to give access to\). This also means that the infrastructure relies heavily on **YOU.**

The MESG infrastructure will be running on every single user, and the more users participating in the network, the more secure workflows will be, so we highly encourage you to run the application and start some services.

You can find more details on how to run a node and services [here](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/node/README.md).
