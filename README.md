MESG is fixing software development.   
  
Our open-source architecture allows all technologies to be unified and consolidated under a single technology.   
  
Rather than developers making individual connections to each technology they want to use, they can now make a single connection, to Core's API, to allow Core to manage the connections to all other technologies, on or off the blockchain.

This technology-agnostic hub allows all technologies to play nice together, ushering in a new era of productivity and solutions.

**Arriving Q3 2018: **

Once a connection to Core is made to any technology, this connection can be shared or sold in a Marketplace. 

This provides infinite possibilities for developers and entrepreneurs to create, share or combine existing services to build new and better solutions.

Simply take the best of what has already been created to build your custom solution. Sharing allows you to connect technologies without needing to know the languages of the technologies you're using.

All technologies working together accelerates efficiencies and the discoveries of new solutions.

Let's build.
