# Introduction

MESG is an infrastructure that lets you create workflows in order to automatize everything you want.

Every time an event occurs on one technology, you can attach a list of tasks to execute based on that event. This lets you connect any kind of service, from a simple mail provider to the most complex blockchain technology or even the entire IoT \(Internet of Things\) simply by defining which event to connect to which task.

The goal of MESG is to help build high quality applications that are not restricted by the complexity of the technologies you want to connect to.

MESG is also provides a shared tool library that you can use in order to create different workflows. If you are a developer and want to create complex workflows you should definitely check the , otherwise you can anytime create your workflow using the .

## A decentralized infrastructure

MESG is a decentralized infrastructure based on Blockchain technology and that means your application is secure and not controlled by anyone else than you \(and the people you want to give access to\). This also means that the infrastructure relies heavily on **YOU.**

The MESG infrastructure will be running on every single user of the application, and the more users participating in the network, the more secure workflows will be, so we highly encourage you to run the application and to start some services.   
  
You can find more details on how to run a node and run services [here](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/documentation/tree/b3d92737e4dfd41f30e20d0ab1f2b8dbbf045a2d/node/README.md).
