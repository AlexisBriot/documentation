# Create an account

To create an account, execute the following method:

```bash
mesg-cli account create --name ACCOUNT_NAME --password ACCOUNT_PASSWORD
```

**Warning: **Backup your password in a safe place. You will not be able to use the account if you lost the password.

This method creates a new account secured by your password. We strongly advise to use long randomized password.

You should also [export your account](/./account/export.md) to a safe place to prevent losing access to your workflows, services and tokens.
