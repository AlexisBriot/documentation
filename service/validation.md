# Validation {#validation}

Before each deployment your file will be verified by the MESG CLI but you can check anytime if your file is well formatted and valid using the following command:

```
mesg-cli service validate ./service.yml
```

This command will validate your file and let you know if there is any error.

All definitions can be found in the [Service File](/./service/configuration.md) page.
