# List available services

To list all published services on the Network, run the command:

```bash
mesg-cli service list
```

This command will return all published services with basic information. To have more details, see the [detail command](/service/run/detail.md).

Optionally, you can filter the services published by a specific developer:

```
mesg-cli service list --account ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```
