# What is a service?

A service is a normalized bi-directional communication layer, or simply put, is a connection from any technology to the MESG Core. It allows any event happening on a technology to be forwarded to the MESG infrastructure, and any action on a technology can be triggered from the MESG infrastructure as well. This way, the technology itself doesnâ€™t need any modification: anyone can develop new services for any technology.
