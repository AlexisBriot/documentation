# What is a service?

A Service is a normalized bi-directional communication layer, or simply put, is a connection from any technology to the MESG Core.   
  
It allows any event happening on a technology to be forwarded to the MESG infrastructure, and any action on a technology can be triggered from the MESG infrastructure as well.

**In Q3 2018**, once the Network is deployed, Services will be able to be shared or sold on our Marketplace, allowing users to use any technology without needing to know the code. For the time being, developers will need to create their own Services. 

## Steps in an Service

A basic service is built of two main steps, listening for events, and the execution of tasks.
