# What is a service?

A service is a normalized bi-directional communication layer, meaning that any event happening on a technology can be forwarded to the MESG infrastructure, and any possible actions on a technology can be triggered by the MESG infrastructure as well. This way, the technology itself doesnâ€™t need any modification: anyone can develop new services for any technology.
