# Validate

Once you've done all this great job you need to verify that you didn't made mistakes while writing your service. In order to do that you can use the `service validate` command.

```bash
mesg-cli service validate ./PATH_TO_SERVICE_FOLDER
```

If you don't specify the path to the service folder, the method searches in the current folder.
