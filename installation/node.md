# Deploy a Node

You can deploy a node with a simple command line

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.mesg.tech | bash
```

This will download the [install script](https://get.mesg.tech) and execute it on your computer and will take care of all dependencies.

Note:

If you need you can always install Docker on your side and then pull the `mesg-tech/application` image and start it. More details on the [Github](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/application).
