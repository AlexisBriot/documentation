# Create Your Application

Applications can be built on MESG by attaching an event on one service to a command on another service. These can be configured in any order, and can create chain reactions.


## Steps in an Application

A basic application is built of two main steps, listening for events, and execution of tasks. 

1. [Source](source.md): The event that triggers the workflow. 
2. [Task](task.md): The task to trigger

You can find a list of potential use cases [here](use-cases.md)
