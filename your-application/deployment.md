# Deployment

When you've finished creating your [workflow file](workflow-file.md), [validating it](validate.md) and [testing it](test.md), you're ready to deploy it.

Each deployment will cost you a small amount of tokens. Please be aware that this amount is **not refundable** so make sure to test your workflow correctly.

You can deploy your workflow using the command:

```bash
mesg-core workflow deploy ./PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_FILE
```

If your workflow is valid, it will be deployed through the Network and will be ready for execution.

Congratulations! You've deployed your first MESG workflow that connects technologies through the Network.
