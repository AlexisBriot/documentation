# Validate

Before each deployment, your file will be verified by the Application, but you can check if your file is well-formatted and valid at any time using the following command :

```bash
mesg-core workflow validate ./PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_FILE
```

This command will validate your file and let you know if there are any errors. All validations can be found in the [file](workflow-file.md) section.
