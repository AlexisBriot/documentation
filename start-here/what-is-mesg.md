# What is MESG?

MESG \(pronounced ˈmesij/, or like **message**\) is a technology-agnostic **infrastructure** for decentralized app development. It’s for advancing productivity, allowing users to connect any technology with ease.

MESG allows users to build applications quickly using existing connections, or design a series of tasks that will execute automatically.

Rather than connecting each individual technology directly to your application, users only need to connect to one, [Core](mesg-core.md). Then, Core manages connections to all other technologies.

MESG acts as a filter, and as the communication layer which is compatible with any technology, on or off the blockchain. It intercepts, organizes and dispatches all information from all services and filters it down a single stream of information to your application.  
  
This way, connections to complex technologies can be easily changed or updated, without you needing to update your application, because technologies aren't connected to your individual application, but rather to MESG. 

We are focused on creating the best open-source infrastructure we can build, so we encourage innovators to use MESG to build businesses of all kinds, either catering to the MESG community, or to the world. 

In Q3 2018, we are deploying the Network to complete the MESG Infrastructure. Our network makes it very easy for developers to share and reuse connections to technologies. Making back-end app building a breeze.
