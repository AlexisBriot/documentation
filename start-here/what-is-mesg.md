# What is MESG?

MESG \(pronounced ˈmesij/, or like **message**\) is a technology-agnostic **infrastructure** for decentralized app development. It’s for advancing productivity, allowing users to connect technologies with ease.

MESG allows users to build applications quickly using existing connections to technologies, or design a series of tasks that execute automatically.

Rather than connecting each technology's API directly to your application, users only need to connect to one, Core's API. Then, [Core](core.md) manages connections to all other technologies.

MESG acts as a filter and as the communication layer, compatible with any technology, on or off the blockchain. It intercepts, organizes and dispatches all information from all services and filters it down a single stream of information to your application.  
  
This way, connections to complex technologies can be easily changed or updated, without needing to update your application, because technologies aren't connected to your individual application, but rather to the [MESG Infrastructure](mesg-infrastructure.md). 

We are focused on creating the best open-source infrastructure we can build, so we encourage innovators to use MESG to build businesses of all kinds, either catering to the MESG community, or to the world. 

**In Q3 2018**, we are deploying the Network to unify the MESG Infrastructure. The Network makes it easy for developers to harness the power of decentralization, and to share and reuse connections to technologies. Making back-end app building a breeze.
