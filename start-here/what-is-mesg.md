# What is MESG?

MESG \(pronounced ˈmesij/, or **message**\) is a technology-agnostic **infrastructure** for decentralized app development. It’s an advancement in productivity, enabling you to connect technologies with ease.

The days of unconnected dApps are over. Your application needs only to be connected to one technology: Core’s API. Then, all connections to all other technologies are managed by Core, so your dApp doesn't have to. 

MESG acts as a communication layer that’s compatible with any technology, including blockchains. It organizes and dispatches information from all connected services and filters it down a single stream of real-time information to your application.

This saves hundreds of hours bridging multiple APIs directly to your application to make it work. The time investment required to connect a technology to the MESG Infrastructure is roughly the same as connecting any **one** API to your application.

Your application on MESG can be anything from a multinational dApp store to automating a workflow for a small business, paying your personal bills, or adding notifications to the blockchain. 

With MESG, decentralized applications can now deliver the same superb user experience that centralized apps deliver. The possibilities and use cases are truly endless.

We are creating the best community-driven open-source infrastructure, empowering developers to use MESG to build innovations.

**In Q3 2018**, we are deploying the Network to unify the MESG infrastructure. The Network makes it easy for developers to harness the benefits of decentralization, to share and reuse connections to technologies making back-end app building a breeze. Once a connection from a technology to Core is made, it can be shared for free or sold in a Marketplace, allowing developers to generate income each time their connection is used. We value and incentivize contributions.
