# What is MESG?

MESG \(pronounced ˈmesij/, or like **message**\) is a technology-agnostic **infrastructure** for decentralized app development. It’s an advancement in productivity, enabling you to connect technologies with ease.

Simply connect your application to Core’s API to allow Core to manage connections to all other technologies. This saves hundreds of hours of development bridging multiple APIs directly to your application to make it work. The time investment to connect to MESG’s API is roughly the same as connecting any ONE API to your application.

Your application on MESG can be anything from a multinational dApp store to automating a simple workflow for a small business, or paying your personal bills. The possibilities and use cases are endless.

MESG acts as a communication layer that’s compatible with any technology, on or off the blockchain. It organizes and dispatches information from all connected services and filters it down a single stream of real-time information to your application.

We are creating the best community-driven open-source infrastructure to empower developers to use MESG to build innovations.

**In Q3 2018**, we are deploying the Network to unify the MESG infrastructure. The Network makes it easy for developers to harness the power of decentralization, to share and reuse connections to technologies making back-end app building a breeze. Once a connection from a technology to Core is made, it can be shared for free or sold in a Marketplace, allowing developers to generate income each time their connection is used. We want to incentivize and value contributions.
