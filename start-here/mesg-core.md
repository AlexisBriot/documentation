# MESG Core

MESG Core is an application that each of the Nodes run, making up the MESG Network.   
  
MESG Core manages all communication with all technologies and services in the Network, instead of your application having to connect to each, and to manage the communication. Your application needs only to connect to MESG Core's API to access any technology.

Then, MESG Core facilitates the communication between all nodes, and all technologies connected to the MESG Network, allowing everything to work together. 

MESG Core is not the foundation of your application, but rather an external self-regulating API that your application communicates with.

MESG Core allows all nodes in the network to communicate with each other, and connect to any technology in any language with ease. 

In the first stage of MESG deployment, the MESG Core will be used to directly communicate with your application, then communicate with any other technology. 

In Q2 of 2018, once the network is deployed, MESG Core will take an alternative role as the receiver of tasks to deploy to the network.
