# MESG for Developers

MESG makes developing simple.  
  
When developers normally create applications, or get technologies to work together, they have to make many individual connections from their application to all of the technologies they want to use.

So, it's a lot of work with so many communication pathways to install and maintain.   
  
With MESG, your application connects to one API, MESG Core, and the core manages the connections to all other technologies for you. 

This idea has been done before in various ways, but what hasn't been done before is: 

* The compatibility with any blockchain technology
* Running all processing through a decentralized blockchain-hybrid network

In Q3 2018, we are deploying our MESG Network to complete the MESG Infrastructure. Our network makes it very easy for developers to share and reuse connections to technologies. Making back-end app building a breeze.
