# MESG for Developers

MESG makes developing simple.  
  
When creating applications, or getting technologies to work together, many individual connections from your application to all of the technologies you want to use must first be made.

It's a lot of work with so many communication pathways to install and maintain.   
  
With MESG, your application has one connection, to Core's API, and the Core manages the connections to all other technologies for you. 

This idea has been done before in various ways, but what hasn't been done before is: 

* The compatibility with any technology on or off the blockchain
* Running all processing tasks through a decentralized blockchain-hybrid network

In Q3 2018, we are deploying the Network to complete the MESG Infrastructure. Our network makes it very easy for developers to share and reuse connections to technologies. Making back-end app building a breeze.
