# Installing Core

Connect your computer with Core with the following command line:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.mesg.tech | bash
```

Once entered, it will automatically download the [install script](https://get.mesg.tech), execute it on your computer, and take care of all dependencies.

## Docker CE

To provide compatibility with any technology, MESG also requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run on your machine.

If you don't have Docker installed on your machine yet, you can download it now from their official website:

* [Mac OS](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
* [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
* [Other](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

**Note:**  
If you would rather work from the Docker image, you find more details on [Github](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/application).

**What's next?**  
You can start by creating your application [here](../your-application/create-your-application.md).
