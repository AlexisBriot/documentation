# MESG for Entrepreneurs

Create your business using MESG.   
  
MESG is an open-source infrastructure which allows you to utilize blockchain technology without needing to build or maintain your own.

ICOs and companies can use our solution-building infrastructure to connect any technology on or off the blockchain with ease. 

The magic is in MESG Core, which is a layer in-between your business and all technologies. It manages communication and the receiving and deployment of information and tasks.

Our technology-agnostic platform allows you to harness the power of any technology connected to the internet, including the Internet of Things.  
  
Connect to anything while only needing to communicate with a single API, which connects to all other technologies, both on and off the blockchain. 

Reverting all communication traffic through MESG Core, rather than your application, allows you to have a lightweight application with infinite power and complexities. 

In Q3 2018, the MESG Network will debut, offering a secure decentralized network to store applications and process the deployment and execution of tasks. 

The MESG Network will offer the scalability of a decentralized network, and the available added security of the blockchain. 

The Network also offers a sharing resource, allowing users to share connections to technologies, instead of needing to create it themselves, or find them elsewhere online. 

Come build with MESG, where applications can be easily built and maintained, utilizing any technology on or off the blockchain.
