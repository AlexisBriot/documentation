# MESG Infrastructure

The MESG Infrastructure is made up of all users’ computers, connected to each other and all running MESG Core

Each individual computer on the network running MESG Core is called a Node. Nodes do all of the processing power in the network.

The MESG Network is a two-part network consisting of one blockchain-based network and one non-blockchain based network that links everyone’s computer together.  
  
We use both types of decentralized networks to maximize the best features of each. You can have the security of blockchain technology, while also allowing ample space for large transfers, or speed for data needing to be sent quickly.

The developer creating the application chooses when the blockchain will be used, and when the traditional network is used, to maximize both speed and security in your application.

When a Node is used to make a a task happen, they will get compensated for their effort in MESG tokens. Also, developers who initially connect technologies to to MESG will also get paid for their work.

MESG Network is the lifeblood of MESG, allowing builders to share their work, and to have an easy place to build and make revolutionary connections.
