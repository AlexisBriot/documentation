# Core

Core is an application that manages all communication with all technologies.

Rather than your application needing to connect to many technologies' APIs, your application needs to connect to only a single API, to connect to any other technology, on or off the blockchain.

Core is not the foundation of your application, but rather an external communication manager for your application.

In the current stage of MESG deployment, Core is an application used to directly communicate with your application, then manage communications with any other technology.

Until Q3 2018 when the full [infrastructure](mesg-infrastructure.md) is deployed, users can use GitHub or other resources to share connections to technologies, rather than using the Network to share. Also, applications will be temporarily centralized on the user's machine until the network is ready for deployment.

Once the Network is deployed, Core will take an alternative role as the receiver of tasks, and will utilize the power of the decentralized Network for the processing of the task, and hosting of data rather than your local computer.

See how this all works on [MESG Infrastructure](mesg-infrastructure.md).

Or, begin by installing [Core](core.md).
