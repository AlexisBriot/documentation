# Installation

You can connect your computer with MESG Core with this simple command line:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.mesg.tech | bash
```

Once entered, it will download the [install script](https://get.mesg.tech), execute it on your computer, and take care of all dependencies.

Note:

If you need to, you can always install Docker on the side and then pull the `mesg-tech/application` image and start it. More details on [Github](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/application).

## Docker CE

MESG requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run on your machine.

If you don't have Docker installed on your machine yet, go and download it now from the official website:

* [Mac OS](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
* [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
* [Other](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
