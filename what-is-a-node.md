# What is a Node ?

A Node is an application running and registered on the MESG Network. Nodes are important because MESG is a decentralized infrastructure, and the processing is done by all of the different nodes in the network.

By running the  you will be a node of the MESG Network but still not really participating in the Network. Participating to the Network might use some resources on your computer so this should be an action that only you can take.

Every time you register as a node for a service, you might be selected for one of the following features:

* **Submit an event to the MESG Network**: This is necessary in order to start workflows based on external events
* **Process a task**: Every time a task in a workflow is triggered, you have a chance of being selected to process that task
* **Validate a task**: Every time a node processes a task, other nodes will need to validate the result \(if possible\) and your node can be selected as a validator

As you can see, your node will have a big responsibility in the MESG Network. In order to secure this, you will need to provide a **stake** and a **period of time** that you are willing to run your node.

## Stake

The stake is a system that "punishes" bad actors in the Network. Every Node of the Network needs to deposit a certain number of GEMS to show their sincerity. If they behave appropriately, they'll be able to withdraw their deposit and recover 100% of it. Each time a bad actor misbehaves, a penalty will be applied and a part of their stake will be lost. If there is too much bad behavior, the full stake could be taken.

## Timeframe

In order to have the most stable network and know which Node is reliable, you need to set a timeframe for how long you'll run the service. If the timeframe is not respected, this will lead to a penalty based on the stake, as described in the [stake part](what-is-a-node.md#stake)

The stake and the timeframe will be important because the selection of nodes is based on those two parameters. So, it's recommended to have a high stake and a long timeframe. Of course you can create a node anytime with no stake and no guaranteed timeframe, but the probability of being selected will be lower.
