# What is MESG ?

MESG is an infrastructure that let you create your workflows in order to automatize everything you want.

Every time an event occurs on one technology you can attach a list of tasks to execute based on that event. This let you connect any kind of services from a simple mail provider to the most complex blockchain technology or even IoT \(Internet of Things\) simply by defining which event to connect to which task.

The goal of MESG is to help building some high quality applications that are not restricted by the complexity of the technologies you want to connect to.

MESG is also a set of tools that you can use in order to create your different workflows. If you are a developer and want to create complex workflows you should definitely check the CLI, otherwise you can anytime create your workflow using the CLI Application.
