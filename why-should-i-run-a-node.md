# Why should I run a Node ?

Running a Node will use some resource on your computer and you will need to stake some  to register to the network so you might wonder why you should run a node.

This page is here to explain you why it might be important for you to run your own node. You will benefits of all the following points.

## Earn 

In MESG, every time your Node is selected and it behave correctly you will receive a reward to thanks you for helping the network and to cover the fees you had to pay because of your participation.

There is 3 different steps where your node can be selected \(and then can earn \)

**As an emitter** your node might dispatch events from a specific service to the MESG Network and you will get  based on the price per event defined in the service and the number of other Nodes that dispatched this same event.

**As an executor** your node might be selected to process a task from a specific workflow and you will get  based on the price of the task you are running

**As a validator** your node might be selected to validate the procesing of a task and you will get  based on the price of the validation of the task and the number of validators selected by the workflow.

## Dedicated resource for my Workflow

When you create a Workflow that uses multiple services you might want to make sure that this workflow will always be executed regardless the status of the network.

To ensure that you can deploy your own node to make sure that you will always have at least one node running the service required for your workflow to run.

You can also if you need more security and less trust over the network run your wokflow on this node and this one only. In this case you will be able to have fully encrypted data with zero knowledge over the network and 100% of the executions on your node and then have a more centralized application.

## Participate to the Network

This is the most ideological part. If you like the idea of MESG and want to help the project growth.
