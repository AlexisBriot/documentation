# Why run a Node ?

Since running a Node uses resources on your computer, and you'll need to stake  GEMS to register on the network, you may be wondering why you should run a node. Here's why:

## Earn 

In MESG, every time your Node is selected, and it behaves correctly you'll receive a reward to thank you for helping the network, and to cover your participation fee.

There are 3 instances in which your node can be selected \(and can earn\):

**As an emitter** your node could dispatch events from a specific service to the MESG Network and you'll earn based on the price per event, as defined in the service and in the number of other Nodes that dispatched the same event.

**As an executor** your node could be selected to process a task from a specific workflow and you'll get GEMS based on the price of the task you're running.

**As a validator** your node could be selected to validate the processing of a task and you'll get GEMS based on the price of the task's validation and the number of validators selected by the workflow.

## A dedicated resource for my Workflow

When you create a Workflow that uses multiple services, you might want the assurance that this workflow will always be executed regardless the status of the network.

To have assurance, you can deploy your own node so you will always have at least one node running the service required for your workflow to run.

If you need more security and trust in the network, run your workflow on one node only. In this case you will be able to have fully encrypted data with zero knowledge over the network and 100% of the executions on your node and then have a more centralized application.

## Participate in the Network

This is the most ideological part. If you like the idea of MESG and want to help the project growth. Join us!
