# Installation

### Using NPM

```bash
npm install -g mesg-cli
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn global add mesg-cli
```

You will now be able to use the `mesg-cli` command or the `mesg` alias.

> Note that you don't have to globally install the MESG CLI as it's listed as a development dependency in the boilerplate project you'll use. However, we still recommend that you install it.

### Docker CE
